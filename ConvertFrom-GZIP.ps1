Function ConvertFrom-Gzip
{
<#
.SYNOPSIS
This function will decompress the contents of a GZip file and output it to the pipeline.  Each line in the converted file is 
output as distinct object.

.DESCRIPTION
Using the System.IO.GZipstream class this function will decompress a GZip file and send the contents into 
the pipeline.  The output is one System.String object per line.  It supports the various types of encoding 
provided by the System.text.encoding class.

.EXAMPLE
ConvertFrom-Gzip -path c:\test.gz

test content

.EXAMPLE
get-childitem c:\archive -recure -filter *.gz | convertfrom-Gzip -encoding unicode | select-string -pattern "Routing failed" -simplematch

Looks through the c:\archive folder for all .gz files, those files are then converted to system.string 
objects, all that data is piped to select-string.  Strings which match the pattern "Routing failed" are returned to the console.

.EXAMPLE
get-item c:\file.txt.gz | convertfrom-Gzip | out-string | out-file c:\file.txt

Converts c:\file.txt.gz to a string array and then into a single string object.  That string object is then written into a new file.
